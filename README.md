Authors:
* Derek Drake
* Mark Forget

# 1. Data Collection:
* The data selected for this project was adapted from:
  http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/baseball.dat.txt

# 2. Experimental Comparison of Numerical Algorithms:
* Three interpolation methods were chosen:
    * Piecewise Linear Interpolation
    * Cubic Spline Interpolation
    * Linear Least Squares Approximation
