# Final Project - Numerical Analysis(CSCE 440)
Authors:
* Derek Drake
* Mark Forget

# 1. Data Collection:
* The data selected for this project was adapted from:
  http://jse.amstat.org/datasets/baseball.dat.txt

# 2. Experimental Comparison of Numerical Algorithms:
* Two interpolation methods were chosen:
    * Piecewise Linear Interpolation
    * Cubic Spline Interpolation

# 3. Presentation of Results:
